## Problem Statement
* __Ideal :__ In school, students need to learn mathematics not only for taking the exam but also can use their knowledge to solve the problem in daily life.
* __Current :__ Currently, children have learning difficulties through mathematics when there is quite poor calculation fluency. Based on the Primary School Evaluation Test (UPSR) in 2016, the percentage of the student that get E in mathematics is 21.6%.
* __Consequence :__ If students having a problem in their mathematics, they will not only get bad results for their examination, but they also cannot use mathematics in daily life as well as counting money, measure the distance.
* __Aim :__ Therefore, by developing this learning basic learning mathematics using augmented reality, students will be able to understand mathematics better and interesting to learn.

## Objectives
* To develop a mobile application to learn basic mathematics operation by applying augmented reality.
* To evaluate the technology acceptance of the proposed mobile application.

## Scope
* This mobile applications is for the students who learn basic mathematics operation.
* This mobile application will cover basic mathematics such as addition, subtraction, multiplication and division.

## Software used
* __Unity__: Version 2019.3.5f1.
* __Vuforia__: Update soon.
* __Visual Studio 2017__

## Features
* Will update soon.
